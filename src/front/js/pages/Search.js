          example, you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from the
          hall to this room.” “ Frequently.” “ How often ?”’ “Well, some
          hundreds of times.” “Then how many are there ?” “How many? I don’t
          know.” “Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen, ‘That
          is just my point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because
          I have both seen and observed. Bythe-way, since you are interested in
          these little problems, and since you are good enough to chronicle one
          or two of my trifling experiences, you may be interested in this.” He
          threw over a sheet of thick, pink-tinted note-paper which had been
          lying open upon the table. “It came by the last post,’ said he. “ Read
          it aloud.” The note was undated, and without either signature or
          address. “There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight
          o'clock,” it said, “‘a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a
          matter of the very deepest moment. Your recent services to one of the
          royal houses of Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be
          trusted with matters which are of an importance which can hardly be
          exaggerated.

          sound of horses’ hoofs and grating wheels against the curb, followed
          by a sharp pull at the bell. Holmes whistled. “A pair, by the sound,”
          said he. “Yes,” he continued, glancing out of the window. “A nice

        that I had better go, Holmes.” “Not a bit, doctor. Stay where you are. I
        am lost without my Boswell. And this promises to be interesting. It
        would be a pity to miss it.” “ But your client —” “Never mind him. I may

        step, which had been heard upon the stairs and in the passage, paused
        immediately outside the door. Then there was a loud and authoritative
        tap. “Come in!” said Holmes. : A man entered who could hardly have been
        less than six feet six inches in height, with the chest and limbs of a
        Hercules. His dress was rich with a richness which would, in England, be
        looked upon as akin to bad taste. Heavy bands of Astrakhan were slashed
        across the sleeves and fronts of his double-breasted coat, while the
        deep blue cloak which was. thrown over his shoulders was lined with
        flamecolored silk, and secured at the neck with a brooch which consisted
        of a single flaming beryl. Boots which extended half-way up his calves,
